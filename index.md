        <li><strong>HTTPS is a must, meow!</strong> Always use SSL/TLS to encrypt data. GitHub Pages gives you free HTTPS, meow meow. Never let your users' data get sniffed by bad dogs, meow.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure headers, meow!</strong> Add Content-Security-Policy (CSP) to block naughty scripts. Example, meow:
            <pre class="bg-gray-200 p-2 rounded">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';</pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Input validation, meow meow!</strong> Don't trust user inputs‚Äîsanitize them to avoid XSS attacks. Meow, those are like fleas on a cat!</li>
        <li><strong>Regular updates, meow!</strong> Keep your site's dependencies fresh. Outdated code is like leaving catnip out for hackers, meow.</li>
